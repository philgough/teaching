			<h2>Crimes of the Hot</h2>

			<p>Is the Space Pope reptilian!? There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Really?! Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>

			<h2>That's Lobstertainment</h2>

			<p>I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! You don't know how to do any of those. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Do a flip!</li>
				<li>She also liked to shut up!</li>
				<li>Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>A Clockwork Origin</h2>

			<p>And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Kids have names? Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. No, she'll probably make me do it. We don't have a brig.</p>

			<h3>That's Lobstertainment</h3>

			<p>A sexy mistake. Bender?! You stole the atom. It doesn't look so shiny to me. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. With gusto. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.</li>
				<li>You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>When Aliens Attack</h3>

			<p>Bender, we're trying our best. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. No! Don't jump! It must be wonderful. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?</p>
